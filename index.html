        <p>I love to learn and expand my knowledge base so that I’ll always be a valuable, contributing member to any organization.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’ve worn lots of hats in my career and I love being able to step into different positions and lend my assistance to great teams whenever possible! I started as a secretary and have progressively advanced in my professional roles. I’ve worked with sales teams, led customer service teams, taken part in business acquisitions and even helped convert a company from paper to digital! 
        <br>
        <br>
        Due to the Covid-19 pandemic I was laid off from a company that I’d been with for 15 years. I’m using this opportunity to go back to school and pursue an extreme interest of mine – coding! It’s not where I thought I’d be at this point in my life, but I couldn’t be more excited to learn about this field and look for new opportunities!
        <br>
        <br>
        One of my biggest accomplishments was leading a software project from the customer service side that brought over 600 customers to our proprietary, online user interface, transitioning them from a long-term, in-house provider. Watching that interface be developed from start to finish and being able to dabble in the backside of the completed project inspired my passion for coding and encouraged me to go back to school! 
        <br>
        <br>
        I’m currently looking for a professional part-time position, preferably with a tech company while I’m going to school. Something that will give me “a foot in the door” and could turn into a full-time developer position once I’m done with school.
